## Explanation
Our program asks for the user's name and where they go to school. After the user enters this information, the program prints "Hello, *name*. You go to school at *school*"

## Usage
Name: Should be your name, which would be a String.
School: Where you go to school, which will also be a String.

## Installation
Our program requires Python to run.

1) Run Terminal
2) Copy and paste this command "sudo apt-get install python3" and press Enter.
3) If python is already installed on your machine, the terminal will say "python3 is already the newest version (3.9.2-3)."
4) Otherwise, type "y" to install python.
